# INDICATIONS AND USAGE

<span style="color: red;">ACETADOTE is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen in patients with an acute ingestion or from repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSI) (1).
</span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ----------

<span style="color: green;"># Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion
</span>
Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion.

- If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown:
<span style="color: green;">- Administer a loading dose of ACETADOTE immediately.
</span><span style="color: green;">- Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment.

# WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

<span style="color: red;">- Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm: Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. ACETADOTE infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated (5.1).
